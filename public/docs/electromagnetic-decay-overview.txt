## **Project Abstract**

This work is a sound-interference installation that employs the power intensity of ambient electromagnetic waves as a control parameter to disturb and reconstruct the natural environmental sounds of a given space in real time. It symbolizes how the ever-increasing emission of electromagnetic waves in the digital age disrupts the order of nature (entropy), while also serving as a metaphor for the cognitive anxiety and mental exhaustion individuals experience as they oscillate between the natural and digital worlds. By making audiences *“hear”* this process of electromagnetic decay, the project reveals the latent tension between technology and nature in a tangible, auditory form.

## **Background and Artistic Motivation**

The inspiration for this project stems from my lifelong observations of decay—for instance, watching the body of a cat that froze to death on a roadside over the course of a winter—and from the character Chuck in *Better Call Saul*, who suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity. These sources triggered reflections on the nature of decay itself and on how human activity impacts the objective world.

The term *decay* can be understood on three levels: biological, physical/engineering, and socio-cultural. Biologically, decay encompasses the breakdown of organic structures, chemical transformations, energy release, and the irreversible processes affecting living beings—such as putrefaction of corpses, food spoilage, or plant withering. Physically and in engineering terms, decay refers to processes like metal oxidation, signal attenuation, or the accumulation of digital errors that cause system failures—phenomena more closely aligned with entropy increase, which resonates most strongly with the conceptual basis of this project. Here, “electromagnetic decay” functions as a metaphorical borrowing to describe such tendencies. Finally, in socio-cultural and symbolic terms, decay represents the collapse of order and values, the deterioration of spirit and emotion, the aesthetics of decadence and death, and the decline of life or psyche. These metaphoric and psychological dimensions are equally essential to the project’s expressive intent.

The motivation for this work arises from my own experiences of anxiety in the digital era and from a journey back to nature as a way to alleviate it. During this trip, I contemplated issues such as technological exploitation, digital authoritarianism, and the contemporary contradictions in human–nature relationships. My destination was Yushu Prefecture in Qinghai Province, a Tibetan region where natural landscapes are both magnificent and intertwined with Tibetan Buddhism’s profound ties to nature. In contrast to the dense digital saturation of my usual urban environment, this return to an elemental landscape deeply moved me. The encounter with this “law-like nature” (法性自然) compelled me to critically reflect on the accelerating pace of technological development and increasingly efficient information transmission. This reflection ultimately became the foundation of my project.

## **Concept and Introduction**

This project proposes an installation whose function is to use the power intensity of environmental electromagnetic waves as an index of digital information exchange, thereby disturbing the environmental sounds of a given area. The device simultaneously records both the ambient electromagnetic field and environmental audio, then processes the original sound by quantifying electromagnetic intensity before replaying and re-recording it.

Environmental sounds serve as a representation of human subjective perception of the world, while the disturbed, processed audio symbolizes humanity’s continual increase in electromagnetic emissions for technological progress, which physically and ecologically generates a form of electromagnetic decay (entropy increase). It also reflects the cognitive anxiety produced as modern humans find themselves caught between the natural and digital domains.

On an **objective level**, from the perspective of thermodynamics, electromagnetic waves are a form of energy. As power increases, more energy is released into the environment per unit of time, raising the randomness of environmental energy distribution and thus driving the rise of thermodynamic entropy. From an ecological perspective, human-generated electromagnetic radiation has been shown to affect species that rely on magnetoreception—such as bees, birds, and marine mammals—disrupting the “ordered” flow of natural information. This disturbance reduces ecological coherence and manifests as a chronic ecological decay (entropy increase).

On a **subjective level**, humanity’s escalating generation and use of electromagnetic power symbolizes the cognitive biases and self-exposure inherent in processes of *“media migration”* and posthuman integration with machines. Electromagnetic waves, as the fundamental substrate of information exchange, highlight the shifting flows of human consciousness within this migration. Meanwhile, natural environmental sound—originally an expression of the world’s manifestation—is now disturbed by human-made electromagnetic interference, pointing to the latent contradictions of a posthuman world.
